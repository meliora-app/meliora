# Project Description

Meliora is a web application that helps users share their thoughts and emotions by creating social posts describing their experiences, thereby promoting positivity and good values. Unlike the other competitor apps, Meliora provides a follow feature to enables users to follow other members in their community and a reaction feature that allows users to react to posts made by others through positive emojis (hearts, smiley faces, thumbs up, etc.). In addition, as a complementary feature, Meliora also displays the most popular posts for a given week in the homepage based on the number of reactions made by users on a given post. To protect the privacy of users, Meliora also gives members the ability to post anonymously in the community. More importantly, however, Meliora has a negative flag feature and report option that allows members to report any inappropriate posts made by a user. As a frontrunner in this domain, Meliora also provides additional features such as motivational quotes and a mental health resources page that serves to inspire and support individuals in their time of need.
